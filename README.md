# Minecraft Waypoint Tracker
The Minecraft Waypoint Tracker allows a user to save coordinate-specific locations in their Minecraft world. If they want to save the coordinates of a nice village or a medieval castle that they found, they can by running the program, choosing either to create a new waypoint file or load waypoints (locations) from a previously created file. The user can continuously add waypoints and then save once finished.
